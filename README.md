ProXima is a real-time tracking platform for monitoring asteroids and satellites using NASA‚Äôs public APIs. The project provides **interactive orbital visualizations**, **live asteroid tracking**, and integrates directly with NASA‚Äôs NeoWs and TLE datasets.  

üåç Explore how objects move through space, visualize orbits dynamically, and keep up-to-date with near-Earth objects‚Äîall from your browser.

## Note
If ProXima does not appear to be working at a given time, it may be because there have been too many calls to the NASA API. To Resolve this please just allow the server some time before reloading. If certain visualizations appear delayed, it may also be due to temporary API throttling from NASA‚Äôs endpoints. If these Issues persist please feel free to contact me, and I will fix them as soon as possible.
